<h1>Our Inspiration</h1>
<p>Dunsparce is a serpentine Pokémon with a primarily yellow body, blue underside, and blue-and-cream-striped back. Its head is round with a wide mouth extending under its jowls and curving up toward the middle of its face. Its chin is blue with two rounded prongs. Its eyes—round and rimmed with blue—are kept closed, revealing its cream-colored eyelids. On Dunsparce's upper back are two small, white, bird-like wings split into two sections each. Its body ends in a striped, drill-like tail. Though Dunsparce can float slightly with its wings, it avoids detection by burrowing into the ground with its tail. It lives immobile in caves and beneath the earth, where it makes maze-like nests.</p>
<p>-Bulbapedia</p>

<br/><p>Dunsparce inspires all of us to take our play to the next level.  When we are at a wall in our smash careers we think of Dunsparce and imagine how we can surpass it.</p>
